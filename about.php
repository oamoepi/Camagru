                    History of communication is as old as the history of Humanity and Mankind has managed to evolve it along centuries throughout incredible revolutions.
In 1794, Claude Chappe tried to resolve the issue of long-distance communication, that was limited to horse speed at that time. He set up an ingenious communication system of air telegraph during the French Revolution. Chappe’s “tours” (towers) were covered by a mobile mast that could be seen with binoculars from the nearest neighbor tower located at approximately 10 to 15 km.

                    The Paris-Lille line was operational the same year and allows transmissions between the two cities at a speed of 9 minutes per letter throughout 15 towers. Obviously, trans- mission time depends of its length.
In 1844, 534 towers were dispersed on the French territory linking on more than 5000km, the most important cities.
But, this system had 2 big disadvantages: it couldn’t be functionnal by night because, obviously, of the bad visibility, and the number of operators per tower (2 every 15 km).
Fortunately, we are in the 21st century.
